An AI-powered tool such as Firebase Studio was used to support the creation of user interface (UI) screens. It provided intelligent design suggestions, component structures, and visual patterns tailored to the project’s needs, helping accelerate development and ensure consistency in the app’s visual experience.

Currently, the application operates using simulated or static data for most of its features. One of the key next steps is to integrate real backend consumption via REST APIs, which will allow the data to reflect dynamic and real-time information. Additional plans include implementing authentication and advanced state management to enhance the overall user experience.
